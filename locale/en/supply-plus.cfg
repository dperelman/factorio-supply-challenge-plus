[mod-setting-description]
scplus-discard-missing-requirements=Allows loading with mods that remove items listed in supply challenge. They are not required, effectively making the challenge easier.
scplus-lose-on-timeout=Cannot play more after the time limit. This is the behavior of the original supply challenge. Disable for a more relaxed experience. Consider also disabling the display of the timers and enabling auto-advance unless you're wanting to use this as a laxer practice mode.
scplus-display-level-timer=Probably want this enabled in Strict Mode and disabled otherwise unless practicing for Strict Mode.
scplus-display-future-level-timer=In future levels display, show time until the end of each level.
scplus-auto-advance=Advance to next level immediately when requirements fulfilled.
scplus-display-future-levels=-1 for all, 0 to disable, 1 to match original supply challenge. If "Show future requirements" is enabled, for each level, will only show items in the first level they are required in.
scplus-display-later-requirements=After current level requirements also show total amount required for all future levels.
