# Supply Challenge Plus

Factorio mod which takes the Supply Challenge scenario from the base game
and adds some settings to adjust how it is played and provide more
information on what's coming in future levels.

The main reasons for creating this were:
1. Allow playing the supply challenge without time pressure, instead
   just using the requests as a way to give short-term goals.
2. Support playing supply challenge with the
   [Pacifist](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Pacifist) mod enabled, which
   removes some of the items required in some levels, as the default
   progression builds up to the military science pack. Currently it
   just omits the missing items, but it should probably have some mod
   compatibility system for customizing the challenge.
3. Have the display give better notice of what's upcoming in the
   challenge. Currently you can just keep the
   [wiki page](https://wiki.factorio.com/Supply_challenge) open, but
   that information should just be displayed in-game.

Additionally I plan to look into:
1. Not relying on the scenario: since it's a mod, there's no reason to
   not allow playing in "supply challenge" mode in any freeplay game.
2. Related: possibly treat it as a "directed start": i.e., don't end
   the game after all challenges are satisfied.
3. Allow some customization of the challenges. Maybe through a mod setting?

This is currently an early work-in-progress. Create an issue (or a pull
request) if you have an idea for a feature it should have.
